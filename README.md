## Welcome to the hangman game

***Introduction:***

Hangman is a popular word game in which one player('the computer')chooses a secret word and another player ('the human') attempts to guess the word one letter at a time.

If a guessed letter appears in the word, the letter will replace a blank space (represented with the '*' symbol). If not, the guesser loses a chance and a part of the hangman skeleton structure will appear. If the guesser figures out the secret word before he or she runs out of chances, he or she wins. Otherwise, he or she loses.

***How to play***

The game starts with the computer asking for a guess.

The player must choose a letter which belongs to a word from the wordlist.

If the player guesses a letter that is in the secret word, the letter will replace a blank space ("*") in the word.
If the guesses letter is not in the word, the player should lose a chance and a new part of the Hangman figure should appear.
If the player guesses all letters in the word, he or she wins. If the Hangman figure is completed, the computer wins.
In either case, the secret word will be revealed when the game is over.
**GOOD LUCK!!!**
